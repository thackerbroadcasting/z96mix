We recently added a disclaimer to our online radio stream denoting that "You're listening to a demo station, by Thacker Broadcasting". Alongside this, we also standardized the format and bitrate at which we broadcast online.

There is no action required on your end as the listener, aside from continuing to listen as you always have!
